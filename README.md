# AiSD - Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains practical exercises, solutions, and implementations from the "Algorithms and Data Structures" (AiSD) university subject.

## Repository Structure: What's in Each Lab?

The repository is organized into directories, generally named `LabXX` (e.g., `Lab01`, `Lab02`), where `XX` is the lab number.

*   ### `Lab01 - Introduction to Data Structures & Arrays`
    *   **Focus:** Basic programming concepts, introduction to abstract data types (ADTs), array manipulation, dynamic arrays.
    *   **Concepts:** Pointers, dynamic memory allocation, time complexity analysis (Big O notation) for basic operations.

*   ### `Lab02 - Linked Lists`
    *   **Focus:** Implementation of various types of linked lists.
    *   **Concepts:** Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Circular Linked Lists, insertion, deletion, traversal operations, comparison with arrays.

*   ### `Lab03 - Stacks and Queues`
    *   **Focus:** Implementation of LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structures.
    *   **Concepts:** Array-based and linked-list-based implementations of Stacks and Queues, typical operations (push/pop, enqueue/dequeue).

*   ### `Lab04 - Sorting Algorithms`
    *   **Focus:** Implementation and comparison of common sorting techniques.
    *   **Concepts:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

*   ### `Lab05 - Searching Algorithms & Basic Trees`
    *   **Focus:** Efficient data retrieval and an introduction to tree structures.
    *   **Concepts:** Linear Search, Binary Search. Introduction to Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), and basic tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

*   ### `Lab06 - Balanced Trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black)`
    *   **Focus:** Addressing the limitations of simple BSTs by implementing self-balancing trees.
    *   **Concepts:** AVL Trees (rotations for balancing), Red-Black Trees (rules and re-coloring/rotations).

*   ### `Lab07 - Hash Tables`
    *   **Focus:** Implementing efficient key-value pair storage.
    *   **Concepts:** Hash functions, collision resolution strategies.

*   ### `Lab08 - Heaps and Priority Queues`
    *   **Focus:** Building heap-based data structures.
    *   **Concepts:** Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Heapify operation, implementation of a Priority Queue using a heap.

*   ### `Lab09 - Graph Algorithms (Basic)`
    *   **Focus:** Representation and basic traversal of graphs.
    *   **Concepts:** Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List representations. Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traversals.

*   ### `Lab10 - Graph Algorithms (Advanced) & Shortest Path`
    *   **Focus:** Solving common graph problems.
    *   **Concepts:** Dijkstra's Algorithm (Single Source Shortest Path), Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
